<h2> Definition: </h2> 
In a simple way we can define Grid System as  a graphic design that divides your screen into lines and columns creating cells. The purpose of it, is to simplyfie the organization of components, pleacing them within specficly "blocks".This system provides a structured layout, making it easier to arrange and align elements on the screen

<b> Heres an example: </b>
<div>
    <img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/05/CSS-GRID-3.png" width="430px" height="400px">
</div>

A better way to write this code and that have the same result is using the command repeat(), where you pass the number of rows/columns and the other sets the size
