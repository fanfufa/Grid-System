<h2> Definition: </h2> 
In a simple way we can define Grid System as  a graphic design that divides your screen into lines and columns creating cells. The purpose of it, is to simplyfie the organization of components, pleacing them within specficly "blocks".This system provides a structured layout, making it easier to arrange and align elements on the screen

<b> Heres an example: </b>
<div>
    <img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/05/CSS-GRID-3.png" width="430px" height="400px">
</div>

<h2> How to use on your code </h2>

<b style="color: #F16529"> HTML  </b> <br>
In your HTML, you'll need to include a container, represented by a class. The concept is akin to a real container - a box that houses elements and those ones are limited to the defined area of it

<b style="color: #2465F1"> CSS  </b> <br>
Here is where most of the things happen. The first thing is set the propertie grid in the container's class display

The next you step would set the tags grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, which is going to define the number and size of columns and rows

In the example, 2 columns of 300px each is create, and also 2 rows of 1 fr each. You can add how many rows and colums you want, just need to enter a new comand like : 200px 1fr or 1rem. <br>
This code could be improve by using the command repeat(), where you pass the number of rows/columns and sets the size
